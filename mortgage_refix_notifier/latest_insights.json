The official data tell us that growth is underway. Our economy grew 0.8% in the March quarter after rising 0.5% in the December quarter. The recession ended late last year, and we have been growing at an annualised rate of 2.6% which is about the average for the past quarter of a century.", "Yet we also have more up to date data in hand telling us of abrupt shrinkage in the manufacturing and services sectors, falling house prices, and falling consumer spending. The recent 1.3% growth surge is highly unlikely to continue."]}
