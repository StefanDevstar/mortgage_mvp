You are a professional mortgage advisor.

Generate a simple 30-day follow-up email to the client because their fixed-rate expiry is approaching. Keep it very short and simple as per this format:

Subject: Reminder: Your Fixed Rate Expiry is Approaching

Hi {client_info['Customer']},

I have emailed you a couple of times letting you know that your fixed rate expiry is coming up, and there‚Äôs only 30 days left (expiry date: {expiry_date}).

Have a look at the email I sent you and let me know if you would like a run down of the situation to explore your options.

Let me know if you would like to explore your options.

Kind regards,  
Advisor
