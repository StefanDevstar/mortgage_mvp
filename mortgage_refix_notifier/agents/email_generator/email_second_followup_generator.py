                Subject: Follow-Up: Fixed-Rate Home Loan Expiry - Action Needed

                Hi {client_info['Customer']},

                Hope you are doing well.

                This is a gentle reminder regarding your lending with {client_info['Lender']}, as you have a facility coming up for refix in the next {weeks_to_expiry} weeks (on {expiry_date}).

                Your {client_info['Lender']} loan details:
                Facility 1: ${client_info['Loan_Amount']:,} â€” action required.

                We can request rates from {client_info['Lender']} to ensure that you are getting the best deal possible and help you through the refix process.

                Please let us know how you would like to proceed.

                Kind regards,  
                Advisor
